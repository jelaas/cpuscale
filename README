CPU autoscaler for virtual guests.
Enables and disables CPUs depending on CPU idle percentage.

cpuscale [-D] [-v] [-L N] [-H N] [-delay N]
 -D          daemonize, disabled -v
 -v          increase verbosity/debugging
 -L N        set idle low threshold to integer N [20]
 -H N        set idle high threshold to integer N [100]
 -delay N    set cpu disable delay to integer N [30]

-delay is in seconds.
Thresholds are base idle percentages.
Number of online CPUs will be taken into account when making decisions.
Percentages are calculated using stats read every second from /proc/stat.
